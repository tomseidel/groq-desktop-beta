# Context Management Strategies for Groq Desktop

## 1. Introduction

Effective management of chat history and context is critical for Large Language Model (LLM) applications like Groq Desktop. As conversations grow, especially with the inclusion of tool calls (which involve multiple message exchanges per interaction), the total number of tokens can quickly exceed the model's context window limit. This impacts performance, cost, and the LLM's ability to maintain conversational coherence.

This document outlines the current approach and proposes enhanced strategies for context management within Groq Desktop, drawing on best practices identified through research [[1]](https://verticalserve.medium.com/genai-managing-context-history-best-practices-a350e57cc25f), [[2]](https://community.openai.com/t/best-practices-for-chat-conversation-storage-and-context-optimization-with-openai-api-3-5-turbo/712166), [[3]](https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-manage-chat-history-effectively/1116419).

## 2. Current Approach (Based on Project Documentation)

Groq Desktop currently implements basic context management:

-   **Token Counting:** Uses `tiktoken` (`electron/chatHandler.js`) to calculate the token count of the message history before sending it to the LLM.
-   **Truncation:** Automatically removes the *oldest* messages (`electron/messageUtils.js`, likely) when the calculated token count exceeds the selected model's context limit.
-   **Tool Call Inclusion:** Persists and includes the full sequence of assistant requests (`tool_calls`) and tool responses (`role: "tool"`) in the chat history sent to the model.
-   **Image Data Stripping:** Removes image data from older messages to save tokens when applicable.

## 3. Challenges with Current Approach

-   **Loss of Early Context:** Simple truncation removes the beginning of the conversation, which might contain crucial setup information or context.
-   **Tool Call Bloat:** Each tool interaction adds at least two messages (request and result) to the history. Complex workflows with multiple tool calls significantly accelerate context window consumption.
-   **Lack of Summarization:** Potentially valuable information from older messages or completed tool interactions is lost entirely rather than being condensed.

## 4. Proposed Enhanced Strategies

Based on best practices, the following strategies could be implemented to improve context management:

### 4.1. Summarization Strategy

-   **Goal:** Condense older parts of the conversation or specific message types (like tool interactions) to retain key information using fewer tokens.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   When the token count approaches the limit (e.g., 80% of the context window), trigger a summarization process.
    -   Use a separate, potentially smaller/faster LLM call to summarize:
        -   A chunk of the *oldest* messages (e.g., the first N messages or messages exceeding the 80% threshold).
        -   Completed tool call sequences (the `tool_calls` request and the corresponding `role: "tool"` result).
    -   Replace the original messages/tool calls with a single "summary" message (e.g., `role: "system", content: "Summary of earlier conversation: <summary text>"` or `role: "system", content: "Summary of previous tool interaction (<tool_name>): <summary text>"`).
    -   **Consideration:** Requires additional LLM calls for summarization, adding latency and potential cost, but preserving context more effectively than simple truncation.

### 4.2. Advanced Truncation ("Windowing" or "Middle-Out")

-   **Goal:** Preserve the beginning and end of the conversation, assuming the initial messages and the most recent exchanges are most important.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   When truncation is needed, keep the first message (often the system prompt or initial user query) and the N most recent messages.
    -   Remove messages from the *middle* of the conversation history.
    -   **Variation:** Could keep the first message, the last N messages, *and* a summary of the middle section (combining with 4.1).
-   **Reference:** Discussed as an alternative strategy in community forums [[3]](https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-manage-chat-history-effectively/1116419).

### 4.3. Selective Context Inclusion

-   **Goal:** Dynamically choose which parts of the history are most relevant, potentially prioritizing recent messages and summaries over full historical detail.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Always include the system prompt (if any) and the N most recent messages.
    -   Include summaries of older conversation parts or tool calls (as generated in 4.1).
    -   Potentially filter out intermediate "thinking" steps or less critical exchanges if fine-grained control is desired (more complex).

### 4.4. Token Count Awareness and Thresholding

-   **Goal:** Proactively manage context *before* hitting the absolute limit.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Continue using `tiktoken` for accurate counts.
    -   Define a threshold (e.g., 80-90% of the model's context limit).
    -   When the threshold is reached, trigger one of the above strategies (Summarization, Advanced Truncation) instead of waiting for the hard limit.

## 5. Recommendations for Groq Desktop

1.  **Implement Thresholding:** Trigger context management *before* hitting the model's hard limit (e.g., at 80-90% capacity) using `tiktoken`.
2.  **Prioritize Summarization:** Implement Strategy 4.1 (Summarization). This offers the best balance between token reduction and context preservation.
    -   Start by summarizing the *oldest* block of messages when the threshold is hit.
    -   Consider adding specific summarization for completed `tool_calls`/`role: "tool"` pairs, replacing the raw messages with a concise summary of the tool's action and result. This directly addresses the "Tool Call Bloat".
3.  **Refine Truncation (If Summarization is Too Slow/Costly):** If real-time summarization proves problematic, implement Strategy 4.2 (Advanced Truncation), keeping the first message and the N most recent, potentially combined with *offline* or periodic summarization of chat history stored locally.
4.  **Configuration:** Allow users (perhaps in advanced settings) to choose the context management strategy (e.g., "Truncate Oldest", "Summarize Oldest", "Keep Start/End") or adjust the threshold percentage.
5.  **Frameworks (Future):** While frameworks like LangChain offer pre-built memory modules [[1]](https://verticalserve.medium.com/genai-managing-context-history-best-practices-a350e57cc25f), integrating them deeply into the existing Electron/Node.js structure might require significant refactoring. Focus on implementing the core logic (summarization, thresholding) within the current architecture first (`chatHandler.js`, `messageUtils.js`).

## 7. Phased Implementation Plan

This plan outlines steps to incrementally implement the enhanced context management strategies:

**Phase 1: Thresholding & Basic Summarization**

*   **Goal:** Implement proactive context management using a threshold and introduce the simplest form of summarization.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Modify `ensureContextFits` Trigger:** Trigger management based on a percentage threshold (e.g., 85%) of the context limit, not just when exceeding it.
    2.  **Create `summarizeMessages` Function:** Develop a function to call an LLM (potentially a smaller/faster one) to summarize a given block of messages.
    3.  **Integrate Summarization into `ensureContextFits`:** When the threshold is exceeded, attempt to summarize the oldest messages. If successful, replace the old messages with a system message containing the summary. If summarization fails, fall back to the current truncation behavior.
    4.  **Testing:** Verify summarization triggering, message replacement, context fitting, and failure fallback.

**Phase 2: Tool Call Summarization**

*   **Goal:** Specifically address context bloat from tool interactions.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Identify Completed Tool Sequences:** Add logic to detect `assistant` messages with `tool_calls` followed by their corresponding `tool` result messages.
    2.  **Enhance/Create Summarization for Tools:** Adapt the summarization function to specifically summarize a tool request and its result(s).
    3.  **Integrate Tool Summarization:** Modify `ensureContextFits` to prioritize summarizing the oldest completed tool sequence *before* attempting general message summarization.
    4.  **Testing:** Verify identification and summarization of tool interactions and the impact on token count.

**Phase 3: Advanced Truncation ("Keep Start/End" - Optional/Alternative)**

*   **Goal:** Provide an alternative strategy if summarization is too slow or costly.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Add Strategy Choice:** Allow `ensureContextFits` to select behavior based on configuration.
    2.  **Implement "Keep Start/End" Logic:** If selected, keep the system prompt, the first message, and the last N messages, removing the middle section.
    3.  **Testing:** Verify correct preservation and removal of messages according to this strategy.

**Phase 4: User Configuration & Refinement**

*   **Goal:** Allow user control and refine the implementation.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Add Settings:** Expose options in the UI/settings for strategy selection, threshold percentage, and potentially the summarization model.
    2.  **Integrate Settings:** Read and apply these settings in `chatHandler.js` / `ensureContextFits`.
    3.  **Documentation:** Update user guides.
    4.  **Refinement:** Tune defaults and prompts based on feedback and testing.
